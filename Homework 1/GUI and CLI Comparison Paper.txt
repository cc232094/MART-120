In general, the GUI is the interface of a system that is made up of visual buttons, icons or menus that users can normally click on to perform actions whereas the CLI is the interface of a system that is made up of prompts or boxes where the user must input in the specific actions that they want to perform. In GitHub Desktop, the CLI most definitely appears to be the dominant focus of the user’s attention, taking up the most space and having an almost central location on the window. Given that GitHub Desktop’s primary purpose is coding, the CLI is going to be what your average user uses the most as coding is strongly based on user input and CLI. The GUI mainly sits in the background, placed at the top of the window and section to the left of the CLI, with smaller buttons that only open up bigger menus when clicked on. While the CLI doesn’t really give the user any extra information on its usage, possibly because it is assumed that the user is familiar with coding, the GUI will have some form of label like a name for the top buttons, an icon and a name for other buttons or a short description for actions you can perform in one of the menus. The GUI also displays suggestions in the space where the CLI usually appears that describe certain actions you can take if there are no local changes within the repository and thus, no option to put in inputs.
